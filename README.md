In the project I will analyse coffee quality by CQI dataset. Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) has worked to improve the quality of coffee and the lives of people who produce it. Quality is one of the most important variables that influence a coffeeâ€™s value.

In this project I aim to predict "total cup points". Typically, a cupping score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest possible score. In practice, the majority of high-quality specialty coffees usually fall within the range of 80 to 90 points.

Therefore in the project I will consider regression problem. I will use dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi. I will use MAE to check the difference between predicted values of points and real values. In the project I will mainly consider random forest regressor. However I will compare it to decision tree regressor and KNN. I will also implement XGBoost and Neural Network.
